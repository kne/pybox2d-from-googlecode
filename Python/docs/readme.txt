Getting Started
---------------

For building instructions, see the main site. Once installed, check out the testbed 
demos to see what pyBox2D can do (located in ../testbed). Then read the manual located 
on the Box2D wiki, here:

   http://www.box2d.org/wiki/index.php?title=Python_Manual

A possibly outdated local copy is included in this distribution.

For more information on some caveats and key differences between the C++ version 
of Box2D, please see:

   http://www.box2d.org/wiki/index.php?title=Box2D_with_Python

On the wiki, you will also find more useful things of varying quality.
A list of classes and their (usually) accessible members:

Which also links to the doxygenated C++ source (a great resource if you can 
understand it).
