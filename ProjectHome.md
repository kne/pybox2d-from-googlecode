### pybox2d ###
2D physics library for Python under the very liberal [zlib](http://code.google.com/p/pybox2d/source/browse/trunk/LICENSE) [license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib_license).

### News ###

#### Moving to `GitHub` ####
The pybox2d project has been moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d).

#### 2013/2/9: 2.3b0 ####
2.3b0 is available on the Downloads page and on [PyPi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Box2D/2.3b0) (this corresponds to Box2D [r253](http://code.google.com/p/box2d/source/detail?r=253)).

I also wrote an OpenCV example based on [this paper](http://www.kirp.chtf.stuba.sk/pc11/data/papers/053.pdf). [Check it out](http://code.google.com/p/pybox2d/source/browse/trunk/examples/opencv?spec=svn367&r=367) and see if you can come up with some nice results.

#### 2011/5/20: Pure Python port ####
As a proof of concept, I wrote a pure Python version of Box2D. Without SWIG, it's much cleaner than pybox2d, but it's also much slower. [Check it out](http://code.google.com/p/pybox2d/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fpure_python) on the SVN and help me improve it!

#### 2011/2/26: The move to 2.1... ####
After some months of inactivity and hesitation, the 2.1 test branch has been moved into the main trunk. There will be more details sometime soon on the development blog.

For those who wish to still access the old 2.0.2 svn, it is available at:
```
svn co https://pybox2d.googlecode.com/svn/branches/box2d_2.0
```

#### 2009/2/25: Release ####
2.0.2b1 Released. Lots of changes since the last version. See all of the changes in this post [here](http://pybox2d.blogspot.com/2009/02/are-we-ready-for-new-release.html), along with some other important code change notes there.

Be sure to download the [testbed](http://pybox2d.googlecode.com/files/pybox2d-testbed-2.0.2b1.zip), which includes all of the examples, in addition to the library itself as it is no longer included in the installer.

#### 2008/10/23: Release ####

2.0.2b0 Released. OS X and win32 installers in the downloads section along with a full source release.
